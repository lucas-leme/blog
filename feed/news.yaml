  description: '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I have been
    lurking on this sub since the moment I signed up for Level 1, having never created
    a post of my own. I just received my charter today after beginning my journey
    in January of 2023. I figured I would create this post to share some tips that
    I felt were key to my success over the past few years. No one asked for this but
    I thought it might be helpful to someone.</p> <p>For reference, I used Kaplan
    for all three levels. </p> <ol> <li><strong>Maintain a fitness regimen</strong>.
    I feel as if this was the single most important aspect to my weekdays - creating
    a separation between my full time job and nightly studying. I do not know the
    biology at all, but there is something that a good workout does to the brain that
    allows you to function better overall, both physically and cognitively. I utilized
    a simple PPL (Push, Pull, Legs) split that didn''t take more than an hour at a
    time. There were often times (towards the end of exam prep) where I would listen
    to masterclasses during my weight and / or cardio sessions. I recognize how hard
    it can be to fit in to a busy schedule, but I highly recommend this be a priority.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality over quantity</strong>. Throughout all three levels (during
    the week) I usually did not surpass two hours per day of studying. I found that
    trying to cram as much as possible per day was not accretive to my studies, and
    was even more destructive when my sleep was sacrificed. I kept my one or two hours
    per day as a &quot;non-negotiable&quot;, meaning basically that I did not skip
    any days. Once you get in the habit of studying daily, it becomes second nature.
    As a consequence, I utilized a longer overall study period: almost 10 months for
    L1, 8 months for L2, and 8 months for L3. I understand how this might not work
    for others, but it worked for me.</li> <li><strong>Very limited note taking</strong>.
    I found that if I started to take notes on each individual section, I would be
    far too focused on small details in the module, and simply not ever reference
    them again. At the end of L2 and L3 - during the revision stage - I created a
    2 page word document where I would write down pesky ideas or formulas that continued
    to trip me up on mock exams. It was basically like a Kaplan &quot;One Sheet&quot;
    but tailored specifically to my weaknesses. I would highly recommend this. However,
    if I had taken notes on each individual section, I would have far too much information
    to review at the end.</li> </ol> <p>TLDR: Stay fit, don''t overdo yourself on
    the quantity of your studying, and take notes only when absolutely essential.
