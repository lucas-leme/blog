    Doing This:</strong></p> <p>We understand that many members of our community have
    questions and seek advice about their careers in finance, investment management,
    and related fields. To keep our subreddit focused on CFA exam content and discussions,

    direct users to these designated weekly threads.</p> <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>

    when participating in this thread. Be respectful and considerate of others, and
    refrain from sharing personal information.</p></li> </ol> <p><strong>A Note on
    Career Posts:</strong></p> <p>Starting from today, we will be removing individual
    career-related posts and kindly redirecting users to these weekly &quot;Career
    Questions Thursday&quot; threads. This change is intended to keep our subreddit
    organized and focused on CFA-related topics, while still providing a valuable
    platform for career discussions.</p> <p>We hope this new initiative will create
    a supportive and informative space for all of you seeking career advice within
    the CFA community. Remember, your fellow members are here to help, so don''t hesitate
