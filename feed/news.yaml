  description: The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) flood maps, which designate
    areas at risk of flooding, are updated periodically through the Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) and community efforts. Even so, many maps are several
    years old. As the previous two posts in the <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/11/blog-series-on-the-economic-and-financial-impacts-of-extreme-weather-events-in-the-feds-second-district/">Extreme
    Weather</a> series show, climate-related risks vary geographically. It is therefore
    important to produce accurate maps of such risks, like flooding. In this post
    we use detailed data on the flood risk faced by individual dwellings as well as
    digitized FEMA flood maps to tease out the degree to which flood maps in the Second
    District are inaccurate. Since inaccurate maps may leave households or banks exposed
    to the risk of uninsured flood damage, understanding map inaccuracies is key.
    We show that, when aggregated to the census tract level, a large number of maps
    do not fully capture flood risk. However, we are also able to show that updates
    do in fact improve map quality.
