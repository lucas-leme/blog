  description: <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I know that the recommended time
    to pass the levels is 300 hours, but I put in almost 800 for level 1. (thankfully
    passed in the 90th percentile). I am giving level 2 in august and I am almost
    done with 2 whole subjects. I will just keep reading and reading till I have perfected
    the syllabus, like I did for the first level.</p> <p>I am still in college andI
    know there usually is an opportunity cost when it comes to how you spend your
    time in college, but working on the charter gives me an odd sense of purpose and
    keeps me motivated to maximise my college GPA as well.</p> <p>It also doesn't
    help that I genuinely love studying the charter material. At this point it has
    become a way for me to pass time and learn new things.</p> <p>Am I crazy to put
    in so much time for something that recommends you put in way lesser? I sometimes
    really question if what I'm doing is sensible or if I am just wasting my time
    by studying so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Careless-Ad7344">
