  description: '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have seen posts on this sub that
    level 2 is twice harder than level 1. If level 1 is walk on the beach then level
    2 is Normandy etc. I disagree with all those posts. I passed both level 1 and
    level 2 on the first try and I spent almost same time on level 2 while doing better
    on section wise score. Some reasons that I can think of is - </p> <ol> <li><p>I
    graduated from college long time back. Getting into study mode was hard. I couldn''t
    manage my time properly and forgot how to take notes. So it took me some time
    to get into flow. For level 2, I knew what schedule worked for me, what behaviors
    to change etc. I already had a study structure and I just read the new info</p></li>
    <li><p>Coming from a STEM background, I had zero knowledge of lots of subjects
    in level 1. This was not case in level 2. I knew lot of stuff. I felt confident.
    </p></li> <li><p>I knew how to approach LOS. I made sure that I understand what
    I was being asked. It was also helpful that I could get the big picture. </p></li>
    </ol> <p>So if you are like me, non finance background, don''t worry too much
    about level 2 and keep up good habits you picked up from level 1.</p> <p>EDIT
    1: ETHICS CURRICULUM IS SAME. Yes I am screaming. If you have studied ethics properly
    in level 1 you can see all gotchas immediately. I revised from my level 1 notes
    in like an hour and then just did the questions from CFAI question bank.</p> </div><!--
