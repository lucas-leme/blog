    exposures. We propose a new method to measure financial intermediaries' residual
    interest rate risk using high-frequency financial market data. Our method exploits
    all available high-frequency information and is valid under extremely weak assumptions.
    Applying the method to U.S. life insurers, we find their interest rate risk management
    strategies are generally effective. However, life insurers are more sensitive
    to changes in long-term interest rates than property and casualty insurers. We
    show that the term premium helps to explain the difference in sensitivities between
    the two types of insurer.

  description: Joakim A. Weill<br /><br />This paper examines the provision of official
    flood risk information in the United States and its distributional impacts on
    residential flood insurance take-up. Assembling all flood maps produced after
    Hurricane Katrina, I document that updated maps decreased the number of properties
    zoned in high-risk floodplains and incorrectly omitted five million properties,
    primarily in neighborhoods with more Black and Hispanic residents. Leveraging
    the staggered timing of map updates, I estimate they decreased flood insurance
    take-up and exacerbated racial disparities in insurance coverage. Correcting flood
    maps could increase welfare by $20 billion annually, but past map updates distorted
    risk and price signals.

  description: "In this special episode of Flirting with Models, I\u2019m joined by\
    \ two guests: Andrew Beer of DBi and Adam Butler of ReSolve Asset Management.Rather\
    \ than my usual interview format, I wanted to foster a conversation about the\
    \ replication of managed futures strategies.  Specifically, I wanted to bring\
    \ on two practitioners who both share the same high level beliefs \u2013\_namely\
    \ that more investors should allocate to managed futures, that managed futures\
    \ are well suited for replication, and that replication can help dramatically\
    \ reduce fees \u2013\_but differ on the implementation details.And it is in that\
    \ disagreement that I hoped to highlight the different pros and cons as well as\
    \ any embedded assumption in any of these replication approaches.We discuss return-based\
    \ replication, process-based replication, determining the number of markets to\
    \ trade, expectations for tracking error, and more.I hope you enjoy this episode\
    \ with Andrew Beer and Adam Butler."
