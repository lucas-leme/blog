  description: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/svb-silicon-valley-bank-collapse-timeline.html">March
    2023</a> will rightfully be remembered as a period of major turmoil for the U.S.
    banking industry. In this post, we go beyond banks to analyze how fixed-income,
    open-end funds (bond funds) fared in the days after the start of the banking crisis.
    We find that bond funds experienced net outflows each day for almost three weeks
    after the run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and that these outflows were experienced
    diffusely across the entire segment. Our preliminary evidence suggests that the
    outflows from bond funds may have been an unintended consequence of the exceptional
    measures taken to strengthen the balance sheet of banks during this time.
