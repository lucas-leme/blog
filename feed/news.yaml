    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all.</p> <p>I just got done with my Level
    1 earlier today. I thought I would make a post about my experience for the candidates
    who have their exams upcoming as well as for anyone else preparing or planning
    to.</p> <p>For some background info, finance was my major in Uni and I work in
    research for a french bank. I am from India.</p> <p>Personally, I found the exam
    to be pretty easy. It was comparable to the CFAI mocks. I did not do the premium
    mocks. I reached the exam centre about 30 minutes before the reporting time and
    was escorted to the waiting room. After some time, they asked us to put our bags
    in the locker and soon I was frisked and let into the exam room. </p> <p>I finished
    the AM session with 1 hour and 3 minutes left on the clock. I took a 10 minute
    break. During the break I washed my face and drank a can of Redbull because I
    had not slept last night thinking about the exam. The caffeine definitely helped
    me push through the PM session. Finished the PM session with 58 minutes left on
    the clock. I was the first to finish both the sessions, which felt a bit weird
    when leaving the exam centre while everyone else were still writing their exam.</p>
    <p>I found the PM session to be togher than the AM session by a tad bit. Not by
    a big margin though. Of course there are many variables that come into play here
    such as my strong areas, the question set I got, etc. </p> <p>My exam centre had
    headphones that we could put on to cut out noise if needed. I did not use them.
    And I did not find any disturbing noise during the exam. I guess I myself kinda
    made some noise by almost tripping over something as I was leaving for my break
    after the AM session. Ahaha, was embarassing. The exam centre temperature was
    also a bit cold. Unfortunately, I was not really layered. I was just wearing a
    plain black round neck and black trousers (all black, even shoes. Yup). So, had
    to rub my hands together and warm myself once in a while. I recommend you carry
    something to layer yourself so that you can avoid this.</p> <p>Here are my Mock
    Scores:</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zg09co41hf1e1.png?width=455&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99a28bbd81186e2ee0e37a3affbc8105985f5d0">Mock
    Scores</a></p> <p>The first mock I took was in the first week of October, a little
    over a month before my exam date. It was the CFAI Free Mock 1. Then I took two
    mocks from Salt Solutions over the next few weeks, which I found significantly
    tougher than the CFAI mock. And finally the second CFAI free mock and a reattempt
    at the 1st free mock. I was also practing the Salt Solutions quizzes along with
    the LES questions, which I also found to be slightly tougher than CFAI LES questions.
    <strong>Note: For Ethics, I decided to stick to CFAI material striclly since it
    can get a little subjective and CFAI Material is the best for it.</strong> I did
    not take the Premium Mocks. After my first mock, I understood my weakest area
    was Fixed Income. So I drilled a lot of questions there and it definitely helped
    me up my understanding there.</p> <p>Coming to my prep, most of my studies were
    done between July and September. Before that, it was very on and off, not at all
    consistent. I was solely using Salt Solutions for getting through all the readings.
    During 2024 New Year, they were having an offer where I got their full study package
    for free. Now, I think they charge $600. I definitely recommend them if it fits
    into your budget. <strong>Note: Again for Ethics readings, I stuck to CFAI material.
    Just skimmed over Salt Solutions modules.</strong></p> <p>I prepared with a full
    time job. So, it was definitely not easy. The 3 months where I consistently studied,
    I was following the below schedule: </p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">5:45
    AM</th> <th align="left">Wake Up</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>6:00
    AM - 8:00 AM</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>Study</strong></td> </tr>
    <tr> <td align="left"><strong>8:00 AM - 8:30 AM</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>Have
    my breakfast and get ready for work</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>8:45
    AM</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>Leave for work</strong></td> </tr> <tr>
    <td align="left"><strong>9:30 PM - 10:00 PM</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>Reach
    back home from work and have dinner</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>10:00
    PM - 12:00 AM</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>Study / Do question of morning
    readings</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left"><strong>12:30 AM</strong></td>
    <td align="left"><strong>Sleep</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The above
    schedule is not at all fun and I do not find it to be sustainable over a long
    period of time. It definiely burnt me out towards the end of the third month.
    I had to go to office only any 8 days a month (changed now though). But I used
    to go around 4 days average per week beacuse I find it more comfortable to work
    from office. I did not really study during work time. I used to do 10-15 Ethics
    questions after reaching office before starting work. Nothing more. I used to
    watch some Martin Stoyanov''s videos on my way to work, not every day though.</p>
    <p>I spent the whole month of October doing only practice questions and mocks.
    Maybe a little bit of revision using Martin Stoyanov''s YouTube videos. Took the
    week before the exam off from work to do more questions and to drill formulas
    and to just relax mentally.</p> <p>I definitely need a small break now to recover
    from the last few months. I hope this helps you all and in case you have any quetsions,
    I am happy to answer them in the comments or in the DM.</p> <p>I wish you all
    the best of luck with everything!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by
