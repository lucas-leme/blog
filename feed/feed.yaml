  description: "After forty-three months of forbearance, the pause on federal student\
    \ loan payments has ended. Originally enacted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ in March 2020, the administrative forbearance and interest waiver lasted until\
    \ September 1, 2023, and borrowers\u2019 monthly payments resumed this month.\
    \ As discussed in an <a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/an-update-on-the-health-of-the-u-s-consumer\"\
    >accompanying post</a>, the pause on student loan payments afforded borrowers\
    \ over $260 billion in waived payments throughout the pandemic, supporting borrowers\u2019\
    \ consumption and savings over the last three years. In this post, we analyze\
    \ responses of student loan borrowers to special questions in the August 2023\
    \ SCE Household Spending Survey designed to gauge the expected impact of the payment\
    \ resumption on future spending growth, the risk of credit delinquency for borrowers,\
    \ and the economy at large. The findings suggest that the payment resumption will\
    \ have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, on the order of a 0.1\
    \ percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels, and a (delayed)\
    \ return of student loan delinquency rates back to pre-pandemic levels. Across\
    \ groups, we see little variation in spending responses but find that low-income\
    \ borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor\u2019s degree,\
    \ and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic expect the highest likelihood\
    \ of missed student loan payments."

    exposures. We propose a new method to measure financial intermediaries' residual
    interest rate risk using high-frequency financial market data. Our method exploits
    all available high-frequency information and is valid under extremely weak assumptions.
    Applying the method to U.S. life insurers, we find their interest rate risk management
    strategies are generally effective. However, life insurers are more sensitive
    to changes in long-term interest rates than property and casualty insurers. We
    show that the term premium helps to explain the difference in sensitivities between
    the two types of insurer.

  description: Joakim A. Weill<br /><br />This paper examines the provision of official
    flood risk information in the United States and its distributional impacts on
    residential flood insurance take-up. Assembling all flood maps produced after
    Hurricane Katrina, I document that updated maps decreased the number of properties
    zoned in high-risk floodplains and incorrectly omitted five million properties,
    primarily in neighborhoods with more Black and Hispanic residents. Leveraging
    the staggered timing of map updates, I estimate they decreased flood insurance
    take-up and exacerbated racial disparities in insurance coverage. Correcting flood
    maps could increase welfare by $20 billion annually, but past map updates distorted
    risk and price signals.

  description: "In this special episode of Flirting with Models, I\u2019m joined by\
    \ two guests: Andrew Beer of DBi and Adam Butler of ReSolve Asset Management.Rather\
    \ than my usual interview format, I wanted to foster a conversation about the\
    \ replication of managed futures strategies.  Specifically, I wanted to bring\
    \ on two practitioners who both share the same high level beliefs \u2013\_namely\
    \ that more investors should allocate to managed futures, that managed futures\
    \ are well suited for replication, and that replication can help dramatically\
    \ reduce fees \u2013\_but differ on the implementation details.And it is in that\
    \ disagreement that I hoped to highlight the different pros and cons as well as\
    \ any embedded assumption in any of these replication approaches.We discuss return-based\
    \ replication, process-based replication, determining the number of markets to\
    \ trade, expectations for tracking error, and more.I hope you enjoy this episode\
    \ with Andrew Beer and Adam Butler."

  description: "In this episode I speak with Dean Curnutt, founder of Macro Risk Advisors\
    \ and host of the Alpha Exchange podcast.This episode is all about the nature\
    \ of risk.  More specifically, the endogenous risk that can manifest in markets.\
    \  We discuss the crash of 1987, Long-Term Capital Management, the Financial Crisis\
    \ of 2008, the XIV implosion of February 2018, and the 2020 COVID crisis.With\
    \ these crises in mind, we touches upon topics such as reflexivity, crowding,\
    \ risk recycling, and the evolving role of the Fed.  Dean also shares his thoughts\
    \ about the nature of risk, how it is woven into the fabric of markets, and why\
    \ it seems like there\u2019s a crisis every 11 years.For those who love to think\
    \ about risk and the nature of markets, this episode is for you.So sit back, relax,\
    \ and enjoy this episode of Flirting with Models with Dean Curnutt."
