    questions and seek advice about their careers in finance, investment management,

    when participating in this thread. Be respectful and considerate of others, and

    Career Posts:</strong></p> <p>Starting from today, we will be removing individual
    career-related posts and kindly redirecting users to these weekly &quot;Career
    Questions Thursday&quot; threads. This change is intended to keep our subreddit
    organized and focused on CFA-related topics, while still providing a valuable
    platform for career discussions.</p> <p>We hope this new initiative will create
    a supportive and informative space for all of you seeking career advice within
    the CFA community. Remember, your fellow members are here to help, so don''t hesitate
