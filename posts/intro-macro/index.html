<p>A Macroeconomia é uma ciência que visa estudar o comportamento da economia como um todo. Para isso, ela busca explicar o comportamento de variáveis agregadas, tanto no curto quanto no longo prazo. Uma variável agregada é aquela que representa o comportamento de um conjunto de variáveis. Por exemplo, o PIB é uma variável agregada que representa o valor total de todos os bens e serviços produzidos em uma economia.</p>
<p>Nesta introdução, vamos nos concentrar na composição do PIB, com ênfase no Brasil. Ao entender os componentes do PIB, podemos obter insights sobre a saúde e o desempenho geral da economia.</p>
<section id="como-estimar-o-pib" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="como-estimar-o-pib">Como estimar o PIB?</h2>
<p>Nesse estudo, vamos analisar o PIB sob as duas óticas: Oferta e Demanda. Para isso, utilizaremos os dados do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), que são disponibilizados por meio do banco de dados SIDRA <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<section id="oferta" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oferta">Oferta</h3>
<p>Pela ótica da oferta podemos expressar o PIB com base em quatro componentes: Consumo, Investimento, Gastos do Governo e Exportações Líquidas. A ideia por trás dessa abordagem é que o PIB é a soma de todos os bens e serviços produzidos em uma economia. E para produzir esses bens e serviços, é necessário consumir, investir, gastar e exportar — todos termos ligados à oferta.</p>
<p>Na equação <a href="#eq-producao_agregada">Equação&nbsp;1</a>, temos a representação matemática dessa abordagem.</p>
<p><span id="eq-producao_agregada"><span class="math display">\[
    PIB = C + I + G + (X - M)
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Onde: <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> é o consumo, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> é o investimento, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> são os gastos do governo e <span class="math inline">\(X - M\)</span> é a diferença entre exportações e importações, que vamos chamar de exportações líquidas.</p>
<p>Analisando o historico dessazonalizado dos componentes do PIB na <a href="#fig-oferta">Figura&nbsp;1</a>, podemos observar que Investimentos e Exportações Líquidas foram os itens mais voláteis desde os anos 2000, principalmente em momentos de crise. Por outro lado, o consumo e os gastos do governo são mais estáveis.</p>

<p>Durante os 2 primeiros mandatos do Lula, o Brasil passou por um período de forte crescimento econômico. Esse crescimento foi impulsionado por um aumento significativo dos preços das commodities <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, que por sua vez, impulsionou o indicador de Exportações Líquidas.</p>
<p>Em 2008, o Brasil foi atingido pela crise financeira global. No período pré-crise, podemos observar dois aspectos: uma queda significativa nas Exportações Líquidas após o <em>boom das commodities</em> e um aumento nos Investimentos. No auge da crise o Banco Central realizou a manutenção da taxa de juros, indo na direção contrária dos incentivos de crédito, fiscais e de intervenções <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Com essa postura mais hawkish, o Banco Central conseguiu evitar uma deterioração mais drástica das expectativas dos agentes, e nos anos seguintes as taxas de juros foram reduzidas, o que contribuiu para o aumento dos Investimentos.</p>
<p>Já na crise de 2015, o Brasil passou por um período de forte recessão. Nesse período, podemos observar uma queda significativa nos Investimentos e um aumento repentino nas Exportações Líquidas. Essa queda nos Investimentos foi causada pela incerteza política e econômica, que afetou negativamente as expectativas dos agentes. Já o aumento nas Exportações Líquidas foi causado pela forte valorização do Real, que aumentou os incentivos para exportar e reduziu os incentivos para importar.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="renda">Renda</h3>
<p>Pela ótica da renda, podemos expressar o PIB com base em três componentes: Agropecuária, Indústria e Serviços. A ideia por trás dessa abordagem é que o PIB é a soma de todos os rendimentos gerados na economia. E para gerar esses rendimentos, é necessário produzir bens e serviços — todos termos ligados à renda.</p>
<p>Na equação <a href="#eq-renda_agregada">Equação&nbsp;2</a>, temos a representação matemática dessa abordagem.</p>
<p><span id="eq-renda_agregada"><span class="math display">\[
    PIB = A + I + S
\tag{2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Onde: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> é a agropecuária, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> é a indústria e <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> são os serviços.</p>
<p>Analisando o histórico desde os anos 2000, podemos observar grandes tendências na <a href="#fig-renda">Figura&nbsp;2</a>. A principal é o crescimento da Agropecuária, em detrimento da Indústria. A tendência inversa de tais fatores é um reflexo da economia brasileira, que no geral exporta matéria prima e importa produtos industrializados. Olhando para os Serviços, podemos observar um ameno crescimento ao longo dos anos.</p>
<p>Diferente da ótica da oferta, a ótica da renda não é tão volátil. Então mesmo durante as crises, podemos observar uma estabilidade de longo prazo nos componentes da renda.</p>

<p>Na crise de 2015, podemos observar uma queda nos 3 componentes da renda. Essa queda foi causada pela forte recessão, que mesmo com a alta das exportações líquidas (<a href="#fig-oferta">Figura&nbsp;1</a>), não foi suficiente para compensar a queda do consumo, investimento e gastos do governo, resultando uma maior queda na renda nos 3 componentes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusão">Conclusão</h2>
<p>Nesta introdução, vimos como o PIB pode ser estimado sob duas óticas: Oferta e Demanda. A ótica da oferta é mais volátil, e nos permite observar grandes variacões em períodos de crise. Já a ótica da renda é mais estável, e nos permite observar grandes tendências de longo prazo.</p>
