  description: "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve posted about this in\
    \ comments and DMs, but it\u2019s clear we need to make a larger announcement.</p>\
    \ <p>Let me start by saying that I have so much appreciation and respect for people\
    \ who want to spend time working to help the community. That dedication is truly\
    \ amazing and that\u2019s what makes this community so great.</p> <p>However.\
    \ the sheer number of vibe coded AI qbanks we've had posted on the subreddit this\
    \ year is huge and it\u2019s only accelerating. We've removed 3 just recently.\
    \ The proliferation of AI has meant that everyone now has the ability to vibe\
    \ code apps and generate thousands of questions with a single prompt. <strong>If\
    \ you\u2019re thinking about doing this, please don\u2019t.</strong></p> <p>Let\u2019\
    s talk about our rules. Rule #7 is:</p> <blockquote> <p>No shilling or unauthorized\
    \ self-promotion of a product or service.</p> <p>Prep providers, including tutors,\
    \ that are not part of CFAI's Prep Provider Program are strictly prohibited.</p>\
    \ </blockquote> <p>We take this rule very seriously for several reasons. First,\
    \ because we do not want this subreddit to become overrun by commercial interests.\
    \ No one benefits in that scenario. Secondly, CFAI has a process of becoming an\
    \ approved provider. The Mod Team doesn\u2019t have the resources to vouch for\
    \ the quality of every new prep provider so we look to CFAI here. This ensures\
    \ that the providers mentioned here are of a high quality. And, quite frankly,\
    \ 99% of these AI materials have no review process to make sure they\u2019re correct.\
    \ It\u2019s no secret that AI can make mistakes and can gaslight you. <strong>Therefore,\
    \ this is potentially harmful to every candidate that uses them.</strong></p>\
    \ <p>As a moderator, I feel that it\u2019s my responsibility to protect the people\
    \ of the subreddit from this. I\u2019ve seen first hand the frustration of someone\
    \ who has wasted hours of time from being led astray from false information. They\
    \ were so angry. I don\u2019t want anyone here to experience that.</p> <p>And\
    \ then, when someone decides to spend a significant amount of time to create an\
    \ app, they get angry and feel defeated when we remove it. I don\u2019t want that\
    \ either!</p> <p>Lastly, let\u2019s talk about legal issues. I\u2019m not a lawyer\
    \ but here\u2019s my take. A large majority of these apps are either primed with\
    \ questions from CFAI or a third party provider (which might break copyright)\
    \ or have questions copy and pasted verbatim (which absolutely breaks copyright).\
    \ There are also potential trademark issues when you use &quot;CFA&quot; in the\
    \ name of your app. Fair use may or may not apply. We can\u2019t be the arbiter\
    \ of any of this and it\u2019s best if we avoid it altogether.</p> <p>If anyone\
    \ here wants to use AI to study, you\u2019re free to do so. But you need to be\
    \ the one to guide the conversation and the one to ask the questions. That way\
    \ you can cross reference and truly push to find the correct information as you\
    \ go.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR - AI apps are generally bad. Please don\u2019t post\
    \ them.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"\
