    \ SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, </p> <p>I made a post a while ago saying\
    \ that i started studying for an exam only 6 weeks beforehand. I thought i would\
    \ make an actual post about how i did it to help anyone in similar situations.\
    \ </p> <p>For background, i graduated with a BA in applied math and economics\
    \ (double major) at a top public university in the US (you can probably guess\
    \ where in my profile). Then, i got a job at a multi-billion asset management\
    \ firm in equity research. I started working in August, almost at a year now.\
    \ </p> <p>So the reason why i only studied for 6 weeks is because i was busy with\
    \ work + i have a major problem with procrastinating\u203C\uFE0F</p> <p>Here is\
    \ how i studied: </p> <ol> <li>I covered all of Kaplan books in 3 weeks. Skipped\
    \ pre req (didn't even know pre req is a thing til couple days before the actual\
    \ exam). </li> <li>I skimmed everything by studying an hour every day and 3 hrs\
    \ on weekends. </li> <li>Then i spammed qbank with open notes (secret sauce book)\
    \ on weekdays and took mocks on weekends and took a very detailed note on things\
    \ i got wrong. I ended up doing 1200 questions. </li> <li>I dedicated the last\
    \ week for studying heavy weight areas (FI, FSA, equity investments) with ethics.</li>\
    \ </ol> <p>My biggest advice is that no matter what you do, you can't know everything\
    \ so you have to play it by probability. Choose your areas and focus. Mathematically,\
    \ not remembering certain concepts from smaller sections has much lighter consequences\
    \ than not understanding key concepts from FSA. </p> <p>I can answer more case\
    \ by case in the comments if you want to ask anything specifically. </p> </div><!--\
