    \ people who would be disheartened with failing level 1 or level 2 in this past\
    \ week, maybe multiple times as well. I just wanted to give you all some perspective\
    \ into my journey and prove to you that you can pass these exams.</p> <p>June\
    \ 2016 - Failed Level 1 December 2017 - Passed Level 1 June 2018 - Failed Level\
    \ 2 June 2019 - Registered for Level 2 but did not sit the exam as 4 months before\
    \ I lost my job. I was too depressed to even look at my books even though I had\
    \ all the time in the world</p> <p>Then throw in a covid rescheduling in 2020,\
    \ I couldn\u2019t sit it. </p> <p>June 2021 - Failed Level 2 again.</p> <p>I then\
    \ got so disheartened and cried and said \u201Cthis isn\u2019t for me, why am\
    \ I wasting my time. I\u2019m not even in a field where CFA is relevant what\u2019\
    s the point\u201D. I won\u2019t even deny that substance abuse was a problem as\
    \ well. </p> <p>I then worked a job for an additional 2.5 years where the relevance\
    \ of the CFA meant nothing, so I didn\u2019t even bother giving it another crack.\
    \ </p> <p>But then the tide turned, last September I landed a role where in another\
    \ 2-3 years, I could potentially make my move to equity research. And substance\
    \ abuse was no longer a problem, so I thought, it\u2019s time to give it another\
    \ crack. </p> <p>May 2024 - Passed Level 2 with 9 sections above 70%.</p> <p>Trust\
    \ me, no matter how bleak things look, it\u2019s possible for you to get through\
    \ this. If you want it bad enough, you can make it happen. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON\
