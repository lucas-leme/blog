    > <img alt=\"Concerning Chalk &amp; Board (and Nathan Ronen)\" src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PHmpiA7jUOgdXW9622X_8o2Tr_LkUhAF0zAr77BlGOo.jpg\"\
    \ title=\"Concerning Chalk &amp; Board (and Nathan Ronen)\" /> </a> </td><td>\
    \ <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A bit of context to start: </p> <p>This\
    \ community has always valued open and honest discussion, especially when it comes\
    \ to CFA programs and prep providers. You're investing a substantial amount of\
    \ time and money, and you deserve candid and unfiltered insight from fellow candidates.\
    \ </p> <p>Over the years, we\u2019ve noticed some questionable behavior surrounding\
    \ reviews. Given that this subreddit is one of the most active and influential\
    \ spaces for CFA candidates and charterholders, it is not surprising that some\
    \ individuals have attempted to manipulate the system through vote brigading,\
    \ suspiciously similar posts, and coordinated abuse reports to trigger AutoMod.\
    \ The good news is that Reddit\u2019s newer ban evasion tools have made a noticeable\
    \ difference. While Reddit\u2019s anonymity makes it difficult to confirm every\
    \ case, we\u2019ve seen positive movement in curbing this behavior. </p> <p>Now,\
    \ in the spirit of transparency, we received a modmail that we believe the community\
    \ should be aware of:</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cz0hdkkgry3f1.png?width=2322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09640f2043ff1d58ee1fc664d9d2c54de01cb693\"\
    >I blurred the name to avoid any doxxing claim. It was not Nathan Ronen.</a></p>\
    \ <p>For reference, this is the message they wanted removed. It had at least 2\
    \ reports on it before I approved it:</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/apeywtp7sy3f1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85dd32229aa4f58e9db9fd3bde8c81fd209aab22\"\
    >The review in question</a></p> <p>So, why bring this to you? Because receiving\
    \ such a direct request to the mod team is a new development for us. Frankly,\
    \ Chalk &amp; Board has probably been the most discussed topic in aggregate in\
    \ our mod chat and has wasted countless hours from us. We view this as an escalation,\
    \ and it's a direction we're not comfortable with. Our role is to protect the\
    \ integrity of your discussions here, and this kind of pressure directly challenges\
    \ that.</p> <p>And look, having waded through countless reviews, we acknowledge\
    \ that it\u2019s possible that some individuals have had positive experiences\
    \ with Nathan. However, it\u2019s also undeniable that his marketing approach\
    \ is extremely aggressive and we do not want them to use the subreddit inappropriately.\
    \ The best way we can counter that is transparency.</p> <p>Thank you for your\
    \ time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/third_najarian\"\
