    Growth Indicators (EGIs)</a>. Updated quarterly, the EGIs continue to report demographic

    spending (real and nominal)</a> at the national level. This release also launches
    a set of national <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Research/Interactives/Data/equitable-growth-indicators/downloads/10_2023_EGI_national_wealth.pdf?sc_lang=en&#38;hash=E49A671AEAC0EF96A14C4C2386EAAB84">wealth</a>
    EGIs (which will be examined more closely on <em>Liberty Street Economics</em>
    early next year). Going forward, EGI releases will also include a set of <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Research/Interactives/Data/equitable-growth-indicators/downloads/10_2023_EGI_regional_FULL">regional
    EGIs</a>, which will present disparities in <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Research/Interactives/Data/equitable-growth-indicators/downloads/10_2023_EGI_regional_inflation.pdf?sc_lang=en&#38;hash=DB4138CE7FA9CAA78EFE311DF3E2DD9A">inflation</a>,

    spending (real and nominal)</a> in our region. Drawing on the just released EGIs,
    in this post, we present recent gender gaps in the labor market at the national
    and regional levels. We provide a picture of how gender wage and employment disparities
    have evolved since the pandemic, examining and contrasting gaps at the national
    and regional level. We find that the gaps between the employment rates and earnings
    of men and women have declined steadily following the pandemic, but have declined
    perceptibly more so in our region than in the nation.
