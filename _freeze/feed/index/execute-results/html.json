Not in our view. Continued rapid growth faces mounting headwinds from population aging and from diminishing returns to China's investment-centered growth model. Additional impediments to growth appear to be building, including a turn     toward increased state management of the economy, the   crystallization of legacy credit issues in real estate and other sectors, and limits on access to key foreign technologies. Even given generous assumptions concerning future growth fundamentals, China appears likely to close only a fraction of the gap with high-income countries in the years ahead.</td>\n      <td>2023-10-19T11:00:00Z</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Borrower Expectations for the Return of Student Loan Repayment</td>\n      <td>https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/borrower-expectations-for-the-return-of-student-loan-repayment/</td>\n      <td>After forty-three months of forbearance, the pause on federal student loan payments has ended. Originally enacted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the administrative forbearance and interest waiver lasted until September 1, 2023, and borrowers’ monthly payments resumed this month. As discussed in an &lt;a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/an-update-on-the-health-of-the-u-s-consumer\"&gt;accompanying post&lt;/a&gt;, the pause on student loan payments afforded borrowers over $260 billion in waived payments throughout the pandemic, supporting borrowers’ consumption and savings over the last three years. In this post, we analyze responses of student loan borrowers to special questions in the August 2023 SCE Household Spending Survey designed to gauge the expected impact of the payment resumption on future spending growth, the risk of credit delinquency for borrowers, and the economy at large. The findings suggest that the payment resumption will have a relatively small overall effect on consumption, on the order of a 0.1 percentage point reduction in aggregate spending from August levels, and a (delayed) return of student loan delinquency rates back to pre-pandemic levels. Across groups, we see little variation in spending responses but find that low-income borrowers, female borrowers, those with less than a bachelor’s degree, and those who were not in repayment before the pandemic expect the highest likelihood of missed student loan payments.</td>\n      <td>2023-10-18T14:01:00Z</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>An Update on the Health of the U.S. Consumer</td>\n      <td>https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/an-update-on-the-health-of-the-u-s-consumer/</td>\n      <td>The strength of consumer spending so far this year has surprised most private forecasters. In this post, we examine the factors behind this strength and the implications for consumption in the coming quarters. First, we revisit the measurement of “excess savings” that households have accumulated since 2020, finding that the estimates of remaining excess savings are very sensitive to assumptions about measurement, estimation period, and trend type, which renders them less useful. We thus broaden the discussion to other aspects of the household balance sheet. Using data from the New York Fed’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/faq\"&gt;Consumer Credit Panel&lt;/a&gt;, we calculate the additional cash flows made available for consumption as a result of households’ adjustments to their debt holdings. To detect signs of stress in household financial positions, we examine recent trends in delinquencies and find the evidence to be mixed, suggesting that certain stresses have emerged for some households. In contrast, we find that the New York Fed’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/\"&gt;Survey of Consumer Expectations&lt;/a&gt; still points to a solid outlook for consumer spending.</td>\n      <td>2023-10-18T14:00:00Z</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023?</td>\n      <td>https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/how-has-treasury-market-liquidity-evolved-in-2023/</td>\n      <td>In &lt;a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/11/how-liquid-has-the-treasury-market-been-in-2022/\"&gt;a 2022 post&lt;/a&gt;, we showed how liquidity conditions in the U.S. Treasury securities market had worsened as supply disruptions, high inflation, and geopolitical conflict increased uncertainty about the expected path of interest rates. In this post, we revisit some commonly used metrics to assess how market liquidity has evolved since. We find that liquidity worsened abruptly in March 2023 after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but then quickly improved to levels close to those of the preceding year. As in 2022, liquidity in 2023 continues to closely track the level that would be expected by the path of interest rate volatility.</td>\n      <td>2023-10-17T11:00:00Z</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Racial Discrimination in Child Protective Services</td>\n      <td>https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/racial-discrimination-in-child-protective-services/</td>\n      <td>Childhood experiences have an enormous impact on children’s long-term societal contributions.
