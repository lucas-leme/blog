  description: '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Every week I see people hesitating
    if they should enroll for the CFA or not and I figured I would tell my story as
    a recent charterholder.</p> <p>Coming out of undergrad I was really picturing
    myself having a bright career in those high finance kind of jobs, but coming from
    a non-target with a sub 3.0 GPA, being a fresh immigrant with no connections,
    my future in this industry wasn''t looking so great. Still, a few months after
    graduation I was fortunate enough to land a job as a financial advisor at my local
    credit union branch and even if this was not the exact dream job, at the time
    I thought it would still give me exposure to the industry and it might be a great
    foot in the door. Did that for the next couple years, being criminally underpaid,
    but hold onto it as I started having a plan to get closer to my vision. Learnt
    about the CFA and quickly figured this would be my only real option to compensate
    for my miserable academic background and maybe break into the industry someday.
    None of my employers wanted to pay for the exams as they thought it was too high
    of a designation for one of their low level employees so I funded the whole thing
    by myself. Failed level I once, but when I got the results and saw I was actually
    so close to the MPS this was a huge motivation boost to complete the program,
    as many people were saying that CFA might not be for you if you were not already
    a straight A student in school. I just had to sharpen my study methods and ended
    up passing the next three exams in a row. In the end, one can easily pass the
    exams if they decide to put in the hours and the dedication because the content
    and the exams are really not that difficult as long as you have a genuine interest
    for the field and you''re eager to learn. For me, CFA being my only exit opportunity
    out of the shitty banking jobs, this was enough of a motivation to pursue.</p>
    <p>Anyway, as I was studying I was also seeking opportunities. After two years,
    managed to get out of retail banking solely due to my experience, moving to a
    very niche call center at a Top 5 (Canada), that was giving me plenty of time
    to study for the exams during my working hours. Tbh level I will make absolutely
    no difference on your resume, so kept that job for a year and after I passed level
    II, I managed to land my first role in Client Service for a large asset manager.
    Managed to pass level III earlier this year and signed up for my local society.
    Started networking like crazy and noticed how people are now more open to have
    conversations with a stranger when you have 3 letters behind your name.</p> <p>A
    couple weeks after I got the designation, a recruiter hit me up on Linkedin, and
    I will start a new job at the end of the month for a large asset manager, finally
    crossing 6 figures as a 26 yr old coming from a non-target with 0 connections
    in the industry. Thanks to CFA, I was even able to negociate my salary in this
    economy.</p> <p>So yeah, you might hesitate if CFA might be for you or not. I
    believe if you already have a strong academic background, it will add only little
    value to your resume. I''ve met plenty of people who were fortunate to land great
    jobs right out of school and who have no interest in pursuing the designation.
    But if you feel like this would compensate for a shitty background, 100% go for
    it.</p> <p>PS: You will 100% lose your girlfriend in the process, but ended up
    getting a much better one as soon as I became a charterholder.</p> </div><!--
