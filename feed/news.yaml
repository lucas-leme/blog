  description: "In our <a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/10/how-do-banks-lend-in-inaccurate-flood-zones-in-the-feds-second-district/\"\
    >previous post</a>, we identified the degree to which flood maps in the Federal\
    \ Reserve\u2019s Second District are inaccurate. In this post, we use our data\
    \ on the accuracy of flood maps to examine how banks lend in \u201Cinaccurately\
    \ mapped\u201D areas, again focusing on the Second District in particular. We\
    \ find that banks are seemingly aware of poor-quality flood maps and are generally\
    \ less likely to lend in such regions, thereby demonstrating a degree of flood\
    \ risk management or risk aversion. This propensity to avoid lending in inaccurately\
    \ mapped areas can be seen in jumbo as well as non-jumbo loans, once we account\
    \ for a series of confounding effects. The results for the Second\_District largely\
    \ mirror those for the rest of the nation, with inaccuracies leading to similar\
    \ reductions in lending, especially among non-jumbo loans."
