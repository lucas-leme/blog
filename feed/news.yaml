    Questions Thursday&quot; threads. This change is intended to keep our subreddit
    organized and focused on CFA-related topics, while still providing a valuable
    platform for career discussions.</p> <p>We hope this new initiative will create

  description: <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I wanted to
    address something that's been happening behind the scenes and, in the interest
    of transparency, felt the community should be aware.</p> <p>Over the past year,
    we've noticed a significant uptick in reports targeting posts and comments that
    contain negative reviews or critical experiences regarding Boston Institute of
    Analytics. These reports are being filed under various rule violations, but upon
    review, the flagged content does not actually break any subreddit or site-wide
    rules; people are simply sharing their experiences and opinions.</p> <p>To be
    clear:</p> <ul> <li>We cannot verify whether individual reviews are accurate or
    not. That's not our role as moderators.</li> <li>What we can say is that abusing
    Reddit's report system to suppress criticism or manipulate what content stays
    visible is a violation of Reddit's Terms of Service.</li> <li>Mass false reporting
    (brigading the report button, essentially) wastes moderator time and undermines
    the tools meant to keep this community safe.</li> </ul> <p>We'll be reported this
    behavior to Reddit admins.</p> <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong></p>
    <p>Negative reviews that don't break rules will stay up.</p> <p>Positive reviews
    that don't break rules will also stay up.</p> <p>We encourage good-faith discussion
    and welcome all honest perspectives.</p> <p>If you have questions or concerns,
    drop them below.</p> <p>Thanks for understanding.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;
